# Royal Store
This is the main royal store application that features a comprehensive
e-commerce website built with React. It features user authentication, the
ability to add items to a cart, "liked" list, and it emulates orders by displaying
a list of items that have been purchased. It also features a search bar that allows
users to search for items by name, and a filter that allows users to filter items
by parameters, like price range, category, specs, brand name, etc.

```commandline
